    fullContent: `The annual City River Cleanup drive saw an unprecedented turnout last Saturday, with over 300 volunteers from all walks of life dedicating their morning to restore the waterway's natural beauty. Organized by the 'Friends of the River' local non-profit, the event aimed to remove accumulated trash and raise awareness about river pollution.\n\nParticipants, equipped with gloves and biodegradable bags, worked tirelessly along a two-mile stretch of the riverbank. Notable attendees included Mayor Johnson, several city council members, and student groups from local schools. Over 2 tons of garbage, predominantly plastics and non-biodegradable waste, were collected.\n\n"It's heartwarming to see so many people care about our environment," said Jane Doe, lead organizer. "This collective effort not only cleans our river but also strengthens our community bonds." The event also featured educational booths on recycling and sustainable living. Organizers hope this momentum will lead to more consistent conservation efforts throughout the year.`,
